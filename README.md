# Python-OOPS-Project
🧠 A practical Python project to demonstrate OOP concepts like classes, encapsulation, abstraction, and modular design using real-life examples.


📘 Assignment Questions & Covered Topics:
1. Using self 🔁
➤ Create a class Student with name and marks, initialized using self. Add a method display().

2. Using cls 🏷️
➤ Create a class Counter to track number of objects using a class variable and class method.

3. Public Variables and Methods 🔓
➤ Create a class Car with public variable brand and method start().

4. Class Variables and Class Methods 🏢
➤ Create class Bank with class variable bank_name. Add method to change it using cls.

5. Static Variables and Static Methods ⚙️
➤ Create class MathUtils with static method add(a, b) returning sum.

6. Constructors and Destructors 🚪
➤ Create class Logger that prints messages on creation and destruction of object.

7. Access Modifiers 🔐
➤ Create class Employee with public, protected, and private variables. Try accessing all.

8. The super() Function 🧬
➤ Create class Person and subclass Teacher, use super() to inherit constructor.

9. Abstract Classes and Methods 📐
➤ Use abc module to create abstract class Shape and subclass Rectangle implementing area().

10. Instance Methods 🐾
➤ Create class Dog with instance variables and a method bark().

11. Class Methods 🏷️
➤ Create class Book with class variable and method to increment book count.

12. Static Methods 🔧
➤ Create TemperatureConverter class with method to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit.

13. Composition 🧩
➤ Create class Engine and Car, pass engine object to car (composition).

14. Aggregation 🧱
➤ Create Department and Employee classes where department stores existing employee (aggregation).

15. Method Resolution Order (MRO) & Diamond Inheritance 🔺
➤ Create classes A, B, C, and D, call show() from class D to observe MRO.

16. Function Decorators 🎀
➤ Create decorator log_function_call that logs when a function is called.

17. Class Decorators 🧵
➤ Create class decorator add_greeting that adds a greet() method.

18. Property Decorators 🏷️
➤ Use @property, @setter, and @deleter in class Product for _price attribute.

19. callable() and _call_() 📞
➤ Create class Multiplier with _call_() to make object callable.

20. Custom Exception 🚫
➤ Create InvalidAgeError and use it in check_age() function.

21. Custom Iterable 🔁
➤ Create class Countdown with _iter() and __next_() to loop from number to 0.

✔️ self, cls, super()
✔️ Instance, Class, Static Methods
✔️ Constructors / Destructors
✔️ Access Modifiers: Public / Protected / Private
✔️ Inheritance & Method Resolution Order
✔️ Composition vs Aggregation
